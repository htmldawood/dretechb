    <p class="articleText"><span>I</span>t has been almost half a decade since the Playstation 5 has been released and all of us have been waiting for the next gen console to be released. Rumours say it could possibly be released in a target of at least 2027 or 2028, but <mark>2028 is most likely going to be released at that time</mark>, leaving a 7 year gap between the release year of the PS5 and PS6. <br><br>The Playstation 6 is possibly going to be stacked with really good specs and since the rise of AI, they’re going to use it to the advantage by using it for <mark>AI upscaling and frame generation</mark> for graphics and performance, leading to better fps in games. <br><br>For the hardware, they're going to use the <mark>Zen 6 architecture</mark> which would have about 10 cores and the memory, it's gonna have around 30-40GB of GDDR7 memory for higher bandwidth and it will include a 2TB Gen 5 NVME SSD. <br><br>For graphics, it will support <mark>up to 8K@60fps and a stable 4K@120fps.</mark> <br><br>For the price, it might cost <mark>at least $600 or more,</mark> since there's the RAM shortage happening.</p>
