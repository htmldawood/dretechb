    <p class="articleText"><span>T</span>ech companies such as Samsung, Google and Motorola have been known for their folding phones and they have dominated the market, but Apple on the other hand, had never made foldable phones. But that might end today, because there had been rumours that the next iPhone model is going to be a foldable phone, alongside the iPhone 18 lineup. The iPhone Fold will be featuring <mark>a crease-free design, the front camera being under the phone’s display, and potentially be including Touch ID.</mark><br><br>Pricing wise, it’s going to be an expensive phone which will potentially cost <mark>$2000</mark>, as it will be one of Apple’s premium devices. There’s also going to be a Flip model, known as the <mark>(iPhone Flip)</mark>, which is going to fold vertically and act as a normal flip phone. <br><br>So overall, Apple is now stepping up their game by finally making Folding and Flip phones and they will finally have their chance to shine and make a lot of money from this.</p>
