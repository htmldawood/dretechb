    <p class="articleText">As you all know, there are ram shortages which leads to being more and more expensive. The reason why this is happening is because of the rise of AI since they need so much memory, specifically the DDR5 ram for running and training AI models. If you were to look for example 32GB DDR5 ram, it can cost at least $300-$500 for that, which is <mark>too expensive for most average PC gamers.</mark> The best you can get if you want to still be able to game is just sticking to DDR4 ram, which does mean you have to <mark>get an AM4 motherboard for it to be compatible with the ram.</mark> If you want the best AM4 build, the best CPU you can get on this motherboard is the <mark>AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</mark>, as it offers high performance with its v-cache, which makes it the ultimate cpu for the AM4 platform and the best GPU you can get is the <mark>RTX 4080 super or RTX 4090</mark>, offering 4K gaming  and maximum performance. Now for the memory, <mark>at least 16gb DDR4, but 32gb is the maximum to really need.</mark></p>
