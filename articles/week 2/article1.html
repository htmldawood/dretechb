    <p class="articleText"><span>W</span>hile the playstation 4 still has a massive library of games, it’s not really worth getting one for 2026 and here is why:
    <ul>
        <li class="articleText">For performance, they only cap up to 60fps in most online multiplayer games</li>
        <li class="articleText">They have slow loading times since it comes with a hard drive and it won’t be worth the money to upgrade to a fast SSD when at that point you can put money towards the PS5 or even a PC.</li>
        <li class="articleText">Lots of new releases are coming to PS5 anyway, so there would be no point buying a PS4 at this time.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="articleText">
    If you really want to get a console for cheap, then you can consider buying a PS4 Pro, since it offers 4K resolution, like the PS5 and you’re getting more stable frame rates unlike the other PS4 models and you could find one on Ebay for under £150 or $200 if you’re lucky.
    <br>But, for competitive gaming, definitely buy at least a PC or a PS5 as it offers more than 120fps in performance unlike PS4.
