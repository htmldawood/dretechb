    <p class="articleText">Many windows users have absolutely no idea that there were more ways of gaining performance that they never knew about. So, i’m going to give you 3 ways to boost performance on your laptop:<br>
    <ul>
        <li class="articleText"><div class="bold">Disabling optional diagnostic data -</div>Diagnostic data is basically all your errors, logs which are used to fix software technical information—such as log files, error reports, and telemetry—collected from software, systems, or devices to identify, troubleshoot, and repair issues. But there’s optional diagnostic data which is not really needed and it just bloats your computer with all of that, so it’s recommended to turn it off.
        <br><br>To turn it off, go to Settings → Privacy and Security → Diagnostics & Feedback and then switch off “Send optional diagnostic data”
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="articleText"><div class="bold">Turning on Memory Saver -</div>If you use Google Chrome, then there will be an option called memory saver, which helps your computer to save memory usage while keeping your tabs open.
        <br><br>To turn it on, click the 3 dots on the top right → Settings → Performance and then switch on “Memory Saver”   
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="articleText"><div class="bold">Changing your power settings to Best Performance</div>Laptops are usually set to the balanced option, which means you’re missing out on free performance that you’re not taking an advantage of. Balanced mode basically means you’re saving battery but there’s a performance mode which maximizes performance.
        <br><br>To turn it on, go to Settings → System → Power & Battery and then set power mode to Best Performance.<br>It’s recommended to do it if you’re plugged into a charger since using it unplugged could offer you a slightly lower battery life.   
        </li>
    </ul>
